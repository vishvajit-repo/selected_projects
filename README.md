# Machine Learning Models Repository

Welcome to the Machine Learning Models Repository! This repository contains a collection of jupyter notebook for trained machine learning models for various tasks. Each model is designed to solve a specific problem, and this README provides an overview of the available models.

## Models Overview

### 1. Anomaly Detection Model
- **Description**: Anomaly detection model for identifying unusual patterns or outliers in datasets.

### 2. ECG Document Classifier
- **Description**: Document classification model for categorizing electrocardiogram (ECG) reports.

### 3. Fraud Detection CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- **Description**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for fraud detection in Credit Card fraudulent activities.

### 4. Customized Named Entity Recognition (NER) Model
- **Description**: Named Entity Recognition (NER) model customized for recognizing specific entities in text data.
